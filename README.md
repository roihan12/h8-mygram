# MYGRAM API

MyGram is an application where you can store photos and make comments on other people's photos. This application will be equipped with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with tables and the following flow:

- Create: Users can upload their photos to the platform and add accompanying comments.
- Read: Users can view their own uploaded photos along with comments, as well as browse through photos uploaded by other users and their respective comments.
- Update: Users can edit the captions or details of their uploaded photos, as well as modify their comments.
- Delete: Users can delete their uploaded photos, as well as remove their comments from any photo.

This CRUD functionality will provide users with a seamless experience for managing their photos and interactions within the application.
